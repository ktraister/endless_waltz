      <h2 class="h2">Endless Waltz uses several methods of securing your communications:</h2>
      <br>
      <h2 class="h2">Burn After Reading</h2>
      <p class="lead">Messages sent between clients are never stored anywhere. Because of this, they cannot be retrieved by attackers at a later date.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="h2">Kyber Encryption Keys</h2>
      <p class="lead">Kyber is an encryption protocol designed to withstand attack from quantum and traditional computers. Unique Kyber keys are generated for each message sent to an Endless Waltz client. Additional Kyber keys are also used to create encryption tunnels between the Endless Waltz clients and exchange servers to prevent attacks against the generation of the unique Kyber keys, confirm the identity of the remote hosts, and prevent snooping on client interactions.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="h2">HTTPS</h2>
      <p class="lead">HTTPS is the industry standard of encryption for many protocols. It is used for basic encryption of traffic. Because it is very vulnerable to Man In The Middle attacks, it is not relied upon for identification or encryption.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="h2">SSH</h2>
      <p class="lead">SSH Proxying is used for premium clients to circumvent restrictive firewalls. A firewall can be configured to prevent websockets from working, breaking the EW_Messenger. The SSH proxy also provides an additional level of encryption that attackers would have to break to intercept messages.</p>
