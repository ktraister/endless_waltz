# Cubic

## Description
Cubic is an ISO builder available in Ubuntu. It is used to build
new EW_messenger ISOs.

## How To
To start, Download the most current iso. Then, fire up Cubic. 
Update the volume name and iso name to reflect the current 
version. Hit next, and you will be dropped into a root shell
to customize the ISO. 

In the root shell, download the new version and `make install`. 
Be sure to clean up when you're done. 

Proceed with the defaults. Generating the new ISO will depend on the 
computing power of the host machine. Once complete, you will have the
option (requirement) of testing before finishing generating the ISO.
